    All idol girl groups have “teams” dedicated for their <i>kenkyuusei</i>
    (trainees, lit. “research students” in Japanese). There is also a Team
    Unknown, a temporary team created for Nippon48 members that are promoted or
    transferred, but not to a specific team. Finally, members may have a
    concurrent position in two different groups and teams at the same time.
  </p>
  <p>
    The concept of a captain is used to describe a Nippon48 member that is the
    “authority” of a certain team. There is also the concept of a co-captain,
    but for the sake of simplicity, a co-captain is also considered a captain.
  </p>
  <p>
    AKB48 and its domestic sister groups have their own theater managers.
    Currently, Rino Sashihara is the only Nippon48 member to have a concurrent
    position as a theater manager (of HKT48).

    If you want to query any of the idol girl groups or add a Nippon48 member to
    the database, simply click on the corresponding link in the navigation bar
    above. Clicking on a row in the table will direct you to a page where you
    can edit the stats of the respective member. If she is now a former member
    who has graduated (i.e., she recently left her groups), then click on the
    <i>Remove this Nippon48 member</i> button on that page to delete her from
    the database.
